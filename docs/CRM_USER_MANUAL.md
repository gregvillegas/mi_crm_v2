- **Date Pickers**: Both Date and Valid until use a date picker for consistent input.
- **Items**:

  - Unit price column spacing adjusted to avoid wrapping. An Item no. column helps track entries.
  - Unit cost/price inputs use plain numeric fields without spinner arrows; values show full amounts with 2 decimals.
  - Margin% now persists between create and edit, preventing rounding shifts on reload.
  - Text Areas: Introduction, Special note, and Closing default to compact 3-line editors for cleaner forms.
  - Attachments: Upload related files on the proposal screen and choose which ones to include when emailing the client.
- **PDF Generation**: Automatically generates a standardized PDF with Micro Image branding.

- **Currency Support**: Supports both PHP and USD with exchange rate handling.
- **Bank Details by Currency**:
  - When **Include bank details** is enabled, the form shows editable bank details for the selected currency.

  - **USD** proposals use the USD beneficiary/account/SWIFT block.
  - These values are editable per proposal and appear in the generated PDF.
- **Price Validity Options**:
  - In addition to the **Valid until** date, users can optionally enable:
    - **Subject to Prior Sale**
    - **Availability at the time of Order**
  - Selected notes appear under **Price Validity** in the PDF.
- **Approvals**:

### Mass Mailing

The Mass Mailing module allows salespersons to send personalized bulk emails to their assigned customers while adhering to Data Privacy Act (DPA) standards and preventing spam.

- **Campaign Creation**: Create email campaigns with custom subject lines and either custom HTML or builder-based templates.

  - **Templates**:
    - **Hero Promo**
    - **Product Launch**
    - **Newsletter Digest**
    - plus quick text templates such as Product Updates, Quarterly Check-ins, and Promotions
  - **Builder-First Workflow**:
    - Sales users can choose a layout template, upload/select images, enter headline/intro/bullets/CTA, and preview the final email without writing HTML.
    - The system generates email-safe HTML automatically.
- **Campaign Images**:
  - Upload campaign-specific images directly on the campaign form.
  - Mark images as **Embed inline** to place them inside the email body.
  - Non-inline images are sent as attachments.
- **Marketing Media Library**:

  - Sales users can use the saved images inside campaigns where available, without needing to re-upload them manually.
- **Live Preview**: Click the "Preview" button to see exactly how the email will render in a client's inbox before sending.
- **Inline Image Behavior**:
  - **Hero Promo**: uses the first inline image as the hero/banner image.
  - **Product Launch**: uses the first inline image as the banner and the second inline image as the product image.
  - **Newsletter Digest**: uses the first inline image as the main header image and the second as the side image.
- **DPA Compliance & Opt-Outs**:
  - All emails include a mandatory company footer and a secure "Unsubscribe" link.
  - If a customer unsubscribes, the system automatically adds them to an Opt-Out list and blocks them from receiving future mass mailings.
- **Rate-Limited Sending**: Once scheduled, emails are processed in the background using a rate-limited queue. This prevents server blocking and ensures high deliverability by avoiding spam filters.
- **Tracking**: Monitor the progress of your campaign in real-time on the dashboard (Total Sent, Failed, and Progress %).
