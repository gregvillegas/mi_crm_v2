## 3. Sales Funnel

### What it does

The Sales Funnel is a pipeline management tool that tracks all active deals from initial quote to closure. It gives management real-time visibility into the value and stage distribution of opportunities across all teams.

### Funnel Stages

| Stage | Color | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Newly Quoted** | Pink | Fresh quotation submitted, deal just entered pipeline |
| **Closable Deals** | Yellow | High probability deals expected to close this month |
| **Green Funnel** | Green | Project-based, ≥ ₱500,000 SRP |
| **Blue Funnel** | Blue | Services / smaller project, < ₱500,000 SRP |

> Green / Blue classification is **automatic** — the system evaluates the retail value and assigns the stage on save.

### Key Fields per Entry

- Company name, brand, requirement description
- Cost (internal) and Retail/SRP (quoted to customer)
- Profit = Retail − Cost (shown as ₱ and %)
- Expected close date and probability (0–100%)
- Deal outcome: Active · Won · Lost
- Notes (AVP can update notes; email notification sent to AE + Supervisor)
- Link to formal Proposal (retail value auto-syncs from proposal total)

### Dashboard Views by Role

| Role | Scope |
|---|---|
| Salesperson | Own entries only |
| Supervisor / Teamlead | All entries from group members |
| ASM | All entries from assigned teams |
| AVP | All entries across all teams under AVP |

- Closed date recorded automatically

## Admin: Active Users Widget

Available exclusively on the Admin home dashboard.

**How it works:**
- Every page request by a logged-in user updates their `last_activity` timestamp (handled by `UserActivityMiddleware`)
- The dashboard queries all users with `last_activity` within the last **15 minutes**
- No additional database tables — powered entirely by the existing `last_activity` field

**What it shows:**
- User's profile picture or initials avatar
- Full name and username
- Role badge (color-coded by role tier)
- Exact last-seen timestamp
- Human-readable "X minutes ago"

**Configuration:**  
Threshold is controlled in `.env` / `settings.py`:

```python
# crm_project/settings.py
ONLINE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 15  # adjust as needed
```
